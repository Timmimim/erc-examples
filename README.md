# o2r examples

Examples for [Executable Research Compendia](http://o2r.info/erc-spec) and compatible workspaces.
Examples are ZIP archives to allow direct upload to the [o2r reproducibility service](http://o2r.info/architecture/), or directories which must be zipped before upload.

The o2r demo server is available at http://o2r.uni-muenster.de/.

For instructions on how to run the o2r reference implementation locally, see https://github.com/o2r-project/reference-implementation.

**NOTE:** Licenses of examples vary, please check carefully if they suit your needs.

We want to thank everyone who contributed a workspace! Why not [add your own?](http://o2r.info/almost/)
